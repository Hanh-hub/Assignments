This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I use Axios requests/promises for RESTful Countries API. Front end mobile responsiveness built with Flexbox. 

Redux was used for state management, primarily because I wanted to practice getting things set up with Redux, and I wanted a boilerplate for future use.
