This was my first full stack react application.

This SPA uses MongoDB, Express, and React.

I have not deployed this to Heroku yet (and maybe won't anytime soon) so I made a video demonstrating it's functionality. Node package Nodemon let me host a local database. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYxgSm7WxYQ&feature=youtu.be&hd=1">See the demo here!</a>
