# Assignments:
Two main folders (exercises and projects) contain work assigned by <a href="http://vschool.io/">V school</a> instructors.
This repo represents my introduction to programming in JavaScript and the MERN stack. I continue to use it for personal projects, from time to time.

All work done on a MacBook Pro.

<b>Some highlights:</b>

<a href="https://github.com/TaylorBurke/Assignments/tree/master/projects/full-stack">Sleep Bank: </a>a sleep tracker CRUD application. Mobile-friendly, built with MERN stack.

<a href="https://github.com/TaylorBurke/Assignments/blob/master/projects/api-redux/README.md" target="blank">GeoQuery: </a>a front end web application. Mobile friendly, built with React and Axios. Dependent on RESTful Countries API.
