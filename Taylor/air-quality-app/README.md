This project was created with the help of [L1lith](https://github.com/L1lith) who also created the state management library, jabr. I would highly recommend jabr for your next project if you've been using redux but feel it is overkill. The jabr central state management tool is incredibly powerful in its simplicity, which makes 99% of the boilerplate code in redux unnecessary.
